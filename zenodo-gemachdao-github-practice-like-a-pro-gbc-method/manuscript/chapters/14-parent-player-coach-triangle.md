# Chapter 14 — The Parent-Player-Coach Triangle
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- Alignment makes development inevitable.
- Mixed messages undermine growth.
- Roles: parents = structure, coaches = correction, players = effort.
- Communication rules that protect the standard.
- Call: one voice, one plan, one standard.

Every player stands inside a triangle: parent, coach, player.

When roles stay clean, growth accelerates.
When roles blur, kids stall.

Rules:
- correct privately, reinforce publicly
- ask questions before accusations
- keep one primary plan
- don’t coach in the car ride
- teach the player to communicate
