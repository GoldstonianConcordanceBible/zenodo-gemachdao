**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- The standard only survives if people carry it.
- Players: discipline over excuses.
- Parents: structure over comfort.
- Community: support what builds people.

A place like GBC doesn’t stay alive by accident.

A standard can’t defend itself.
A standard has to be carried.

Players: choose discipline.
Parents: choose structure.
Community: support the forge.

Protect what protected you.

Not as nostalgia.

As a living blueprint.
