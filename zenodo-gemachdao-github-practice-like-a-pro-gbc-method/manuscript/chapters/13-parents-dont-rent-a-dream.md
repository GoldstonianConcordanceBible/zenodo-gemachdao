# Chapter 13 — Parents: Don’t Rent a Dream—Build One
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- Parents set the ceiling before the player swings a bat.
- Renting a dream = teams, trophies, quick fixes.
- Building a dream = habits, standards, patient development.
- How to reinforce the Greensboro Method at home.
- Call: protect the standard, raise a grown man.

Parents don’t just support a player—they shape a player.

Renting a dream looks like chasing movement instead of mastery.

Building a dream looks like fundamentals, structure, and consistent expectations.

Protect the standard:
don’t rescue from discomfort,
don’t undermine coaching,
don’t reward excuses.

Standards are love over time.
