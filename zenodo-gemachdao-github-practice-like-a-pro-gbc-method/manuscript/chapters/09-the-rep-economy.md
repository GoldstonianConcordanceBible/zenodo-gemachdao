**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- Reps are the currency of development.
- Volume reps vs. valuable reps.
- Intent, focus, correction, repetition.
- A practical rep plan for players and parents.
- Entrepreneurship parallel: execution compounds like reps.

Every athlete lives inside a rep economy.

Some kids waste reps.
Some invest reps.

Value reps have:
- intent
- attention
- feedback
- repetition

Parents should stop buying random activity—build a plan.

Entrepreneurs: reps = consistent execution.
