# Chapter 5 — The Grind Behind the Doors
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- What the public sees vs. what keeps the place alive.
- The daily grind: maintenance, schedule, personalities, pressure.
- Why “small things” build big results.
- Emotional labor: carrying families, players, expectations.
- The entrepreneur’s edge: outlasting chaos with systems and standards.

There’s a version of GBC people see—and a version they don’t.

The unseen version is the reason the place exists at all.

## The Facility Never Stops Needing You

Nets tear. Turf wears down. Machines break. Everything needs attention.

The owner becomes the quiet hero because if he doesn’t do the work, the work doesn’t get done.

## The Schedule Is a Beast

Every slot has a family attached.
Every change affects someone.

Chaos pressures standards. Standards protect culture.

## The Small Things Are the Big Things

Cleanliness is coaching.
Order is coaching.
Rules are coaching.

## Emotional Labor

Kids and parents bring life with them.

Sometimes the coach carries more than mechanics.

## Systems

Longevity is systems—repeated right decisions that become culture.

## Transition to Chapter 6
Growth forces a decision: evolve or fade.
