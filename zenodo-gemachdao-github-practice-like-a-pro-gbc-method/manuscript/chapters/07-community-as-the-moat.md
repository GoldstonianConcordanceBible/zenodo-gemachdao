# Chapter 7 — Community as the Moat
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- The real advantage wasn’t cages—it was relationships.
- Trust compounds: generations return.
- Community is built through standards, not vibes.
- Consistency, truth, and investment in people create a pillar.
- Call to action: protect what protects you.

GBC lasted because it became a community.

That’s the moat.

Not equipment—trust built over time.

Community isn’t built by being nice; it’s built by being real:
truth, standards, accountability, consistency.

Al became a consistent voice in many young men’s lives.

Community protects kids from environments that reward laziness and ego.
