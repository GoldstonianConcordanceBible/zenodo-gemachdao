# Chapter 17 — The Future: Fields, Facilities, and the Next Generation
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- The future is protecting the standard at scale.
- Facilities matter, but culture matters more.
- Technology is a multiplier only when discipline is present.
- The next generation needs development and direction.
- Call: carry the method forward without watering it down.

The future is only better if the standard survives.

Fields and facilities are tools—not the mission.

The right order:
1) culture first
2) coaching second
3) tools third

The next generation needs structure more than content.

The future is simple:
keep the standard,
grow with intention,
use tools wisely,
build men who lead.
