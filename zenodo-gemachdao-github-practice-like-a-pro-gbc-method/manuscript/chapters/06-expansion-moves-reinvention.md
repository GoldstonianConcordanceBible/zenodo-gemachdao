# Chapter 6 — Expansion, Moves, and Reinvention
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- Growth forces a decision: evolve or fade.
- Expansion isn’t just bigger space—it’s bigger responsibility and risk.
- Changing locations without losing culture.
- Reinvention without selling out: upgrading tools while protecting the standard.
- Lessons: don’t worship comfort—build capacity.

Growth creates pressure.

If you don’t expand, you cap impact.
If you expand, you multiply responsibility.

The question is:

**How do you get bigger without getting softer?**

Expansion costs more than money:
time, energy, systems, quality control.

Culture is fragile, and compromise sneaks in through “small” decisions.

Use tools to amplify work—not replace work.
