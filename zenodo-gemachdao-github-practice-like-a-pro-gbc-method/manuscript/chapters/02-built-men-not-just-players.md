# Chapter 2 — Built Men, Not Just Players
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- Why GBC’s real product isn’t swings—it’s standards.
- The difference between “being coached” and “being coddled.”
- How discipline, humility, and accountability create confidence.
- What Al demanded (and why it worked for 40 years).
- A direct call to players and parents: protect the standard.

There are plenty of places that can teach a kid how to hit a baseball.

There are not many places that can teach a kid how to carry himself.

That’s the difference.

When people say “GBC made me better,” they’re often talking about mechanics. But if you listen close—if you talk to the ones who stayed around long enough—you’ll hear a second story underneath the first:

**GBC didn’t just build players. It built men.**

Not men in the sense of age.
Men in the sense of **responsibility**.

## The Standard Was the Coach Before the Coach Spoke

GBC didn’t work like a place where excuses got catered to. It wasn’t a place where the goal was comfort. It was a place where the goal was **change**.

And change requires friction.

Al understood something most people forget:

**If you remove friction from a young man’s life, you don’t make him happy—you make him weak.**

So he didn’t remove it.

He taught boys how to handle it.

## Coaching Isn’t Always “Nice”—But It’s Always Love When It’s True

Real coaching can hurt your feelings.

Not because it’s disrespectful.
Because it’s accurate.

It’s a mirror.

Mirrors don’t flatter you. They show you where you’re off.

Al corrected what needed correction.
He repeated what needed repeating.
He refused to pretend with you.

That is rare.

## Confidence Comes From Competence

GBC didn’t hand out confidence like candy.

It gave you the path to earn it.

Confidence comes the way strength comes:

**Under load.**

Reps you don’t want to do.
Corrections you don’t want to hear.
Standards you can’t talk your way around.
Failure you have to process and survive.

You stop needing hype.
You start trusting your work.

That’s what men do.

## The Hidden Curriculum: Responsibility

Some lessons at GBC were never written down. They were embedded in the culture:

- Show up on time.
- Respect the space.
- Listen the first time.
- Be coachable.
- Finish what you start.

That’s how men are built: by doing small hard things consistently until they become normal.

## The Parent’s Role: Don’t Undermine the Standard

Some parents sabotage development without realizing it by rescuing their child from discomfort.

A standard only works if the adults protect it.

If a parent wants the coach to be the “bad guy” while the parent plays hero, the kid learns the wrong lesson:
That rules are negotiable.
That correction is disrespect.
That effort is optional.

## Transition to Chapter 3
If Chapter 1 is about *showing up*, and Chapter 2 is about *the standard that builds men*, then Chapter 3 is where we name the actual framework that makes it repeatable.
