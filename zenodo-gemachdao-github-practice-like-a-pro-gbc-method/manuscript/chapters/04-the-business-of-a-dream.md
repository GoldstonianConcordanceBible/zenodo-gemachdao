# Chapter 4 — The Business of a Dream
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- GBC wasn’t built on “love of the game” alone—it was built on business discipline.
- The hidden costs: rent, repairs, equipment, staffing, insurance, reinvestment.
- Reputation is the real marketing: trust compounds over decades.
- How the standard was protected while keeping the lights on.
- Lessons for entrepreneurs: consistency, community, and culture beat hype.

Facilities come and go all the time.

So when something lasts forty years, you’re not looking at luck.

You’re looking at **business discipline**.

GBC wasn’t built on inspiration alone. It was built on the mindset:

**Do what needs to be done—especially when it’s not glamorous.**

## The Myth: “If You Build It, They Will Come”

Passion without structure becomes burnout.

Running a training facility is a people job, a maintenance job, a cash-flow job, a reputation job, and a culture job—every day.

## The Bills Don’t Care About Your Mission

You don’t get decades without the boring grind:
repairs, slow months, turnover, pressure, expectations.

The mission is expensive.

## Trust Compounds

The real moat is reputation built over time.

One family tells another.
One kid improves.
One former player comes back with his own kid.

That’s legacy.

## The Temptation: Lower the Standard

Lowering standards makes money faster—then destroys trust long-term.

Al built a culture, not a commodity.

## Transition to Chapter 5
Next we go behind the scenes to the hidden labor that kept the mission alive.
