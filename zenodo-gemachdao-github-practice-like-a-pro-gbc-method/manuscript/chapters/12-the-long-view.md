# Chapter 12 — The Long View
**Durability. Fundamentals. Discipline.**

**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- The long view separates development from hype.
- Durability is a skill: availability matters.
- Fundamentals survive pressure.
- Discipline protects the long view.
- Call: build a life, not a moment.

The temptation is quick wins.

The long view has three parts:
- durability
- fundamentals
- discipline

Durability is built, not luck.

Fundamentals are boring until the moment gets loud.

Discipline is doing the right thing when nobody claps.
