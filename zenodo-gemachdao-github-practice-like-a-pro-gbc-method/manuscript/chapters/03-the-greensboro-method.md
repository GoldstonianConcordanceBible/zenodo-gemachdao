# Chapter 3 — The Greensboro Method
**Reps. Responsibility. Resilience.**

**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- The Greensboro Method is a repeatable system, not a motivational speech.
- Reps build skill and honesty: the work reveals the truth.
- Responsibility builds character: standards, ownership, and accountability.
- Resilience builds men: how to fail, adjust, and come back stronger.
- A blueprint for players, parents, and entrepreneurs to protect the standard.

People love to call it “talent.”

But talent is the spark.

**The Greensboro Method is the firewood.**

It’s what keeps the spark alive long enough to become something real.

The Greensboro Method has three pillars:

1) **Reps**
2) **Responsibility**
3) **Resilience**

If you have those three, you can build almost anything: a hitter, a pitcher, a team, a business, a family culture, a life.

## 1) Reps — The Truth Teller

Reps are honest.

They build skill and expose character.

A rep is either buying improvement or wasting time.

Value reps have:
- intent
- attention
- feedback
- repetition

## 2) Responsibility — The Ownership Pillar

Responsibility is where boys become men.

You stop blaming everything and replace it with:

**“That’s on me.”**

Parents matter here too:
Respect the coach.
Support the standard.
Don’t create excuses at home.
Don’t chase comfort.

## 3) Resilience — The Comeback Engine

Baseball will humble you.

So the question isn’t “Will you fail?”

You will.

The question is:

**What do you do next?**

Resilience is trained:
- breathe
- adjust
- repeat

## The Method Works Beyond Baseball (Entrepreneur Parallel)

Reps = execution.
Responsibility = ownership.
Resilience = adaptation.

## Transition to Chapter 4
Now that we’ve named the method, we have to tell the business truth underneath it—because there’s a reason most training places don’t last.
