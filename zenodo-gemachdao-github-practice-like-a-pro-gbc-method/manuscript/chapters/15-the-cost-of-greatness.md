# Chapter 15 — The Cost of Greatness (And Why It’s Worth It)
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- Greatness has a price: time, humility, repetition, and discomfort.
- Most people quit at the “boring middle.”
- The cost shows up in lifestyle: sleep, nutrition, priorities, and consistency.
- Parents pay too: structure, patience, and holding the line.
- The payoff: confidence that isn’t borrowed—competence that lasts.

Everybody wants greatness.

But very few people want the bill.

Because greatness doesn’t just cost effort in the moment.
It costs **consistency over time**.

It costs choosing reps when you’d rather relax.
It costs listening when you’d rather argue.
It costs fundamentals when you’d rather skip ahead.
It costs humility when you’d rather protect your ego.

## The Boring Middle Is Where Most People Quit

There’s a stage of development that isn’t exciting.

No huge jumps.
No viral clips.
No instant results.

Just the same work, repeated.

That’s where most people tap out.

Not because they can’t do it.

Because they don’t want to pay the price of being ordinary for long enough to become elite.

## Lifestyle Is the Invoice

The price shows up in:
- sleep
- nutrition
- recovery
- attitude
- schedules
- priorities

You can’t live like a distracted person and perform like a disciplined one.

## Parents Pay a Price Too

Parents pay by holding the line:
- routines at home
- supporting the coach
- refusing to negotiate with accountability
- staying patient during slow growth

## Why It’s Worth It

Because competence lasts.

Competence creates calm under pressure.
Competence creates confidence that doesn’t need hype.
Competence builds men who lead.

That’s the real payoff.
