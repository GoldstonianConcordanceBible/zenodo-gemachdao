# Chapter 11 — From Talent to Toolset
**Outline (3–5 bullets)**
- Talent is potential; toolset is repeatable performance.
- Specialists fail when the game speeds up.
- The toolset: hitting, throwing, fielding, strength, speed, mindset.
- Fundamentals + durability + decisions.
- Call: build the whole man, not the highlight.

Talent is what you might do.

Toolset is what you can do on command—under pressure.

GBC focused on complete athletes:
- hitting
- throwing
- fielding
- strength
- speed/movement
- mindset

Fundamentals are the glue that holds the toolset under pressure.
