Life has a deeper scoreboard.

It shows up ten years later.

The proof isn’t just seasons. It’s men who don’t fall apart.

Dependable men:
- keep commitments
- handle correction
- show up
- protect their name
- don’t panic under pressure

The cage trains life:
patience, accountability, humility, emotional control, resilience, discipline.
