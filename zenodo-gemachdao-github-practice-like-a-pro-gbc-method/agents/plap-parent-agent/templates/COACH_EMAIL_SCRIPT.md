Subject: Development focus for the next 30 days

Coach [Name],
Thank you for working with [Player]. I want to support the plan at home.
What are 1–2 development priorities we should focus on for the next month?
What does “success” look like weekly?
We’ll reinforce the standard and keep communication clear.
Thank you,
