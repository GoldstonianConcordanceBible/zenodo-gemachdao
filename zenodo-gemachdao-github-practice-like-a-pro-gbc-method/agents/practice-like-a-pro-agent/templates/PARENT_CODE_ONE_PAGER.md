## The Non-Negotiables
1) Respect the coach in front of the player.
2) Don’t rescue from discomfort—let growth happen.
3) Protect sleep, nutrition, and routines.
4) Praise effort + character more than outcomes.
5) Car rides are for recovery, not critique.

## Communication Rules
- Ask “What does my child need to improve?” before complaining.
- Correct privately, reinforce publicly.
- One plan at a time (no mixed messages).

## One Standard to Protect
We do not negotiate with accountability.
