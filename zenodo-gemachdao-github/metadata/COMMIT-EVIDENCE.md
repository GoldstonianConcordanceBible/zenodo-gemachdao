# Commit Evidence Packaging Notes

Place your evidence here:
- `provenance/evidence/commit-create-gemach-sol.png`  (screenshot of the commit list or commit page)
- `provenance/evidence/commit-create-gemach-sol.json` (exported metadata)

## Optional: how to export JSON evidence (local)
If you have the repo cloned, you can export a minimal JSON proof for the commit hash.
(Do not invent hashes; paste the real one.)
